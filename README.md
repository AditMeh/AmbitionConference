# AmbitionConference
Welcome to the Ambition Financial Simulator!
This is the ideal environment to apply & practice strategies and skills you've learned - 
all while having a bit of fun! The objective is to accrue as much money as possible and remain financially stable throughout all the
hurdles life throws at you. Doing so will require a strong understanding of stocks and banking, as well as pragmatic money management. If
you happen to fail - no worries! There's no better place for a wake up call than here! Learn from your mistakes, try again, and most
importantly: have fun! Your money will be stored in a chequing account(money for immediate spending) and a savings account and with every
passing day, you will earn interest in each. There is always the looming threat of emergency costs, and food needs to be bought to keep a
myriad of these risks at bay. You can grow your account by investing in stocks and read the news for stock price predictions, but they’re
not always right so it’s up to you to ascertain their validity. The amount of times you can transfer money between your savings and
chequing accounts will be limited so you must be smart about when you transfer money. The game ends when your chequing balance reaches
$0, so aim to stay in the game for as long as possible!
